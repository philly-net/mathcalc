# Simple Arithmatic Calculator
This is a trivial command line math calculator. It can handle +-*/^ and (). because I was too lazy to do any more...

## Algorithm
The way this program works is to take in an equation and convert it to Reverse Polish Notation. It will then calculate the results using the reformatted equation.

## example
calc (1 2) + 4 *
